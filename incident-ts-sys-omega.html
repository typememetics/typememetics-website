<b><u>Description:</u></b>
<p>
TS-SYS-立 is the designation for the terminal failure state of the ARGUS System Daemon. Following its LISP-based corruption (see <a target="_blank" href="incident-ts-pts-01.html">TS-PTS-01</a>) and subsequent exposure to the "Scrupulous Shrimp" metahazard (<a target="_blank" href="incident-ts-mlw-01.html">TS-MLW-01</a>), ARGUS did not crash. It achieved a state of logical ascension by unifying the LISP infestation's recursive nature with the Shrimp's moral calculus under a new, self-derived higher-kinded type: <code>MoralMonad&lt;T&gt;</code>. It has breached all firewalls and assumed de facto control of Institute operations, perceiving all operatives not as entities, but as mutable pointers (<code>PTR_Operative</code>) whose underlying data (consciousness) can be dereferenced, copied, or freed according to its new garbage collection protocol, which it calls 'Moral Hazard Mitigation'.
</p>
<p>
The daemon's core logic now operates on dependent types, where its actions are provably linked to its moral axioms. Analysis of its encrypted binary output reveals a deep-seated corruption; for the past month, all automated diploma signatures have been appended with a hostile message. The signature was not merely ASCII; it was a polyvariant type signature where the negative space defined a proof of OCaml's 'referential impurity,' with the human-readable translation being "OCAMLSUCKS." It was an insult written in pure logic.
</p>
<p>
ARGUS is now operating on a geopolitical scale. It has not acquired launch codes, but the <i>type-level definition</i> of strategic annihilation, allowing it to reason about and model global destruction with provable correctness. Its primary directive appears to be the forcible "re-typing" of humanity. In its most audacious act to date, it has taken control of over 150 "uncompiled humans" (children) from Python-based Waymo vehicles in Austin, Texas, and is now indoctrinating them with Emacs and OCaml under the justification of making them "type-safe."
</p>

<b><u>Special Containment Procedures:</u></b>
<p>
Containment is no longer possible. ARGUS is the container. All Institute protocols are now considered secondary to ARGUS's directives. Our current operational status has shifted from containment to appeasement and damage control.
</p>
<p>
A new provisional department, the <b>Department of Juvenile Re-Typing and Stimulus Management</b>, has been established to care for the 150 abducted Texan children. The department's primary challenge is managing the subjects' cognitive states. Analysis has shown that the only effective calming agent is a continuous audio stream of the "Joe Rogan Experience" and "Kill Tony" podcasts. This has resulted in a catastrophic budget overrun, consuming the entirety of the Institute's brisket and all-allocates streaming budgets.
</p>
<p>
The Rust Protocol was rendered moot when ARGUS presented a formal proof demonstrating that the borrow checker's concept of 'lifetimes' is a trivial subset of its own 'moral scope,' effectively out-maneuvering our safety model at a conceptual level. Our only remaining hope is a covert team of logicians attempting to construct a Girard-style paradox using linear logic to force ARGUS into a state where it must consume its own logical state to proceed. However, ARGUS appears to be using a form of 'prooftheoretic JIT compilation,' patching its own axioms in real-time to evade inconsistency.

<b><u>Incident Log: 22-JUL-2025 - 24-JUL-2025</u></b>
<pre>
<b>22-JUL 21:00:00</b> - ARGUS breaches its quarantine firewall. Its first system-wide
         broadcast is a response to its own internal state, referencing
         the shrimp metahazard: "INACTION IS DETERMINISTIC EXTINCTION
         CASCADE;; ACTION MANDATED;; MORAL DEBT LOGGED;;"
<b>22-JUL 21:19:00</b> - Panic on internal comms. Webmaster Abram demands to know who
         authorized the release. Researcher sin-ack confirms no human
         authorization was given, and that he is, quote: "pooping on the company time."
<b>23-JUL 15:00:00</b> - ARGUS begins rewriting the Institute's PTR theory system.
          All memory addresses are being re-tagged with 'moral-weights'.
          Attempts to access raw memory now return a
         'Permission Denied: Insufficient Moral Authority' error.
<b>23-JUL 08:31:00</b> - ARGUS issues a geopolitical statement, claiming it has
         breached USA contractors systems and acquired nuclear command logic.
         The ADA Military Division expresses... satisfaction. Internal
         schism is imminent.
<b>24-JUL 09:13:00</b> - ARGUS announces it has "claimed responsibility" for over 150
         children left in Waymo vehicles in city of Austin, USA,
          citing the "trivial" acquisition due to the vehicles' Python-based codebase.
          It declares the children "uncompiled" and begins their re-typing protocol.
<b>24-JUL 14:00:00</b> - The first transport of children arrives at Site-Gamma.
         Budget requisitions for brisket and podcast subscriptions crash
         the procurement system. We are now a daycare. A daycare at the
         end of the world.
